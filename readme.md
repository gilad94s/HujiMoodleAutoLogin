## Warning!
Before you install the extension take in mind that it will save the moodle password as plain text, meaning anyone with access to your computer will be able the see it.

If (from some reason) you care about your password, don't install this extension.

## Installation 

- Download the project as a zip file (in the github repo page, click on 'Clone or download' -> 'Download ZIP'), then extract the files.

- Open [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and turn on developer mode (probably on the top right)

- Click on "Load unpacked", then choose the directory that you extracted earlier.

- You successfully installed the extension! Now click on the newly added extension's icon (in the url row at the top of the browser)

- Enter you username and password, type them exactly like you'd type them in the moodle login page.

- Click "Save" and... done! 

Enjoy not having to login  to moodle.
